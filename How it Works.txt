How it Works

CSS variables control spawn rate, sizes, timing, and rounded corners for boxes and the hero frame.

JS measures the hero area, spawns white “boxes” inside the top-right quadrant, and animates them through the monitor corner and out of frame using the Web Animations API.

Accessibility: Particles are decorative (aria-hidden="true"); reduced-motion users have animations disabled via prefers-reduced-motion.

Customizing

Edit CSS variables near the top of index.html to change:

--emit-rate-ms, --size-min, --size-max

--flight-min, --flight-max

--hero-radius, --hero-crop-zoom, --hero-crop-shift

Replace image1.png with your preferred hero image (same file name or update the <img src>).

Deployment

Because it’s static, you can host on any static host (e.g., GitHub Pages). Just publish the root directory.
